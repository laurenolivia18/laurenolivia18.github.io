					They feed mostly on the ground, scavenging along roads and at dumps. Crows will carry hard-shelled mollusks high in air

					<span class="description">Region: This sparrow nests and winters farther north throughout the US than any of its close relatives. Despite the

					In winter in the northern states, flocks of Tree Sparrows are common in open country. They often come to bird feeders
					with Dark-eyed Juncos and other birds. Males may begin singing their musical songs in late winter, before they start

					<span class="family">Family: New World Sparrows | </span>
					<span class="description">Region: Plain in appearance but with a beautiful whistled song, Bachman's Sparrow is an uncommon and elusive resident
					of the Southeast. Its classic habitat is mature pine forest, where it lives in the open grassy understory, flying up to
					low pine branches only to sing. When not singing, this sparrow is extremely secretive, hiding in the undergrowth, and
					it is easily overlooked. Bird is now uncommon and possibly declining in the South.</span><br><audio controls>

					brilliantly colored songbirds in the east, flaming orange and black, sharing the heraldic colors of the coat of arms of
					17th-century Lord Baltimore. Widespread east of the Great Plains, Baltimore Orioles are often very common in open woods

					"Black-and-white Creeper," a name that describes its behavior quite well. Like a nuthatch or creeper it climbs about on
					the trunks and major limbs of trees, seeking insects in the bark crevices. It often feeds low, and nests even lower,
					usually on the ground. Breeds in northern part of continent and as far south as north Georgia.</span><br><audio controls>

					<span class="family">Family: Wood Warblers | </span>
					<span class="description">Region: Breeds in the Northeast, migrates to the Southeast. The lazy, buzzy song of the Black-throated Blue Warbler
					comes from the undergrowth of leafy eastern woods. The bird usually keeps to the shady understory and moves about
					rather actively in its search for insects, but often will forage in the same immediate area for minutes at a time,
					rather than moving quickly through the forest like some warblers.</span><br><audio controls>

					<span class="family">Family: Wood Warblers | </span>
					<span class="description">Region: Among the most numerous warblers in far northern forests in summer, and perhaps the most impressive migrant of
					all our small birds. Every fall, most Blackpoll Warblers make an over-water migration from our northeastern coast to
					northern South America; some may pause in Bermuda or the Antilles, but others apparently fly nonstop for more than 72
					hours. In spring they are more leisurely, traveling via the West Indies and Florida, pausing to sing in our shade trees

					<span class="description">Region: Mainly Northern US hayfields, meadows. Bobolinks in eastern United States nest in hayfields. Migrants stop over
					in fields and marshes, often feeding in rice fields like Georgia’s. Fluttering over meadows and hayfields in summer,
					the male Bobolink delivers a bubbling, tinkling song which, loosely interpreted, gives the species its name. The male
					is unmistakable in spring finery, but before fall migration he molts into a striped brown appearance like that of the
					female. Bobolinks in this plumage were once known as "ricebirds" in the South, where they occasionally used to cause
					serious damage in the ricefields.</span><br><audio controls>

					woods like North Georgia’s; also in suburban neighborhoods. The big, foxy-red bird sometimes forages boldly on open
					lawns; more often it hides among the briar tangles and making loud crackling callnotes. Although it spends most of its
					time close to the ground, the male will sometimes will deliver its rich, melodious song of doubled phrases from the top

					Georgia where any wooded or semi-open area where berries are abundant. With thin, lisping cries, Cedar Waxwings are
					sociable at all seasons, and it is rare to see just one waxwing. Occasionally a line of waxwings perched on a branch
					will pass a berry back and forth, from bill to bill, until one of them swallows it.</span><br><audio controls>

					John James Audubon, roaming eastern North America in the early 1800s, saw this bird only once. The cutting of forests
					evidently has created more brushy habitat for Chestnut-sided Warblers, even as it has made other birds less common.

					<span class="description">Region: Breeds mostly in Northeastern deciduous forests. Winters in tropical rain forest in lowlands just east of the

					leafy upper branches. Sometimes in spring, when the Scarlet Tanagers have just arrived from their winter home in South
					America, a late freeze will force them out in the open as they search for insects on roadsides or in gardens.</span><br><audio controls>

					in brushy fields, streamsides, shrubby marsh edges, woodland edges, hedgerows, well-vegetated gardens. Some coastal
					populations live in salt marshes, like Georgia’s. At times it is rather skulking in behavior, hiding in the thickets,

					<span class="description">Region: In the Southeast, breeds in dry open woods, especially those of oak, hickory, or pine. Winters in the tropics,

					often remaining hidden among the leaves. At times, however, it flies out conspicuously to catch flying insects in
					mid-air. This bird apparently has no fear of stinging insects, often raiding wasp nests and occasionally becoming a
					minor nuisance around beehives.</span><br><audio controls>
